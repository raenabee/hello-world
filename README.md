# **sole employee of a small consultancy since 2011**
- mainly cranked out maps for client project reports prior to 2021 
- love cartography and geoviz
- phobic of coding until fall 2021 (ok at it but very slow. If I tinker long enough I can usually get it to do what I want)
- surprisingly enjoy building web apps and webGIS projects
- overcommitted between school and work, but making it through
